Build:
Install emscripten and make sure emcc is in your $PATH.
./buildall
see output for compiled results.

snem port is outdated, can only be compiled by a very old version of emscripten.
I might update it in future but snes9x seems to be fast enough for modern devices.

snes9x port requires emscripten 1.36+

snes9x is build with sound by default. comment out -Dsound in snes9x/sdl/buildhtml to disable sound.
